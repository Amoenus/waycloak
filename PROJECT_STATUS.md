# Project status

Last updated: 2026-07-13

## Current phase

Waycloak is an implementation-ready inception repository. Product behavior, architecture, API direction, security boundaries, acceptance criteria, and release requirements are documented. No controller or data-plane code exists yet.

## First deliverable

The first usable release is `v0.1.0`: a single shared Gluetun gateway, injected VXLAN agent, fail-closed egress, standard Kubernetes Secret references, and observable status. Port forwarding follows in `v0.2.0` unless it can be implemented without weakening the first milestone.

## Definition of “implemented”

Do not mark the project implemented because manifests render or Pods become Ready. The first proof requires an end-to-end test demonstrating that:

1. an unannotated Pod uses ordinary cluster egress;
2. an annotated Pod exposes the VPN provider public IP;
3. the annotated Pod loses external connectivity when the VPN tunnel or gateway disappears;
4. DNS cannot bypass the gateway;
5. the workload does not receive VPN credentials;
6. removing the annotation and rolling the workload restores ordinary egress;
7. status identifies which gateway and client allocation the Pod is using.

For port-forward support, qBitTorrent is the mandatory reference workload. TCP and UDP ingress must reach it through the provider lease, and DHT must remain healthy across a sustained crawl and at least one lease renewal.

## Known design risks

- Kubernetes Pod Security `restricted` disallows `NET_ADMIN`; Waycloak needs a tightly scoped policy exception for its injected agent and gateway.
- VXLAN availability and CNI behavior vary by cluster.
- Admission failure policy must preserve fail-closed semantics without blocking unrelated workloads.
- Provider port-forward APIs differ and may only grant one port per tunnel.
- Stable client allocation must not be derived from sorted workload names.
- Shared gateways are a failure domain; horizontal scaling requires deliberate sharding rather than HPA on a singleton tunnel.
