## Current phase

Waycloak has completed the Phase 1 control-plane exit and the first Phase 2 deny-first agent slice. The Go/controller-runtime control plane defines `VPNGateway` and controller-owned `VPNWorkload`, persists stable overlay allocations, quarantines released addresses, performs authorized and idempotent Pod admission, and publishes the UID-bound allocation ConfigMap required by ADR 0005. Admission now places the lockdown and verifier init containers before every user init container, including native sidecars.

Phase 1 acceptance passed against the Kubernetes 1.36 local k3s cluster using the same e2e suite that defaults to disposable Kind. It proves unannotated admission is unchanged, unauthorized references are rejected, application startup is blocked while the allocation ConfigMap is absent, allocations survive controller restart and unrelated membership changes, UID binding is preserved, and webhook outage fails closed only for opted-in Pods. Envtest reconciliation also passes against a real API server. The VPN data plane does not exist yet, so gateway and workload `Ready` conditions correctly remain false with reason `DataPlaneNotImplemented`.

The Linux agent uses native nftables and netlink APIs behind a platform interface. It atomically installs a Pod-UID-owned output-drop chain before protected routing, creates a deterministic VXLAN link, uses protocol-tagged policy rules and a dedicated routing table without replacing the CNI main table, actively verifies an observed gateway overlay health endpoint, and repairs owned link, route, rule, and firewall drift. A two-Pod fake-gateway test on Kubernetes 1.36 k3s proves protected VXLAN reachability, all three cluster-traffic modes, state persistence after agent exit, and no direct fallback after abrupt gateway loss. The standalone lockdown test proves direct packets are dropped and unrelated nftables state is preserved.

Phase 2 is not complete. Gateway-routed DNS, DNS leak tests, a minimal agent image, and full injected-Pod lifecycle integration remain. The next vertical slice is the smallest fake gateway/resolver and image packaging needed to packet-test Kubernetes service discovery and external DNS containment before any Gluetun integration.

## First deliverable

The first usable release is `v0.1.0`: a single shared Gluetun gateway, injected VXLAN agent, fail-closed egress, standard Kubernetes Secret references, and observable status. Port forwarding follows in `v0.2.0` unless it can be implemented without weakening the first milestone.

## Definition of “implemented”

Do not mark the project implemented because manifests render or Pods become Ready. The first proof requires an end-to-end test demonstrating that:

1. an unannotated Pod uses ordinary cluster egress;
2. an annotated Pod exposes the VPN provider public IP;
3. the annotated Pod loses external connectivity when the VPN tunnel or gateway disappears;
4. DNS cannot bypass the gateway;
5. the workload does not receive VPN credentials;
6. removing the annotation and rolling the workload restores ordinary egress;
7. status identifies which gateway and client allocation the Pod is using.

For port-forward support, qBitTorrent is the mandatory reference workload. TCP and UDP ingress must reach it through the provider lease, and DHT must remain healthy across a sustained crawl and at least one lease renewal.

## Known design risks

- Kubernetes Pod Security `restricted` disallows `NET_ADMIN`; Waycloak needs a tightly scoped policy exception for its injected agent and gateway.
- VXLAN availability and CNI behavior vary by cluster.
- Admission failure policy must preserve fail-closed semantics without blocking unrelated workloads.
- Provider port-forward APIs differ and may only grant one port per tunnel.
- Stable client allocation must not be derived from sorted workload names.
- Shared gateways are a failure domain; horizontal scaling requires deliberate sharding rather than HPA on a singleton tunnel.
